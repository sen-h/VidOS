# VidOS v2.1.0 "Otis"


"What was your singing for?
This music that rose to enamor
The crowd with a clamor
It could not ignore. . .
Go — with your falsetto roar;
Go — with your ready-made glamour.
Why should you stay here to gurgle
    and stammer 
Of war?"

From "To a War Poet",
by Louis Untermeyer

# About

VidOS is a complete single purpose linux system for x86-64 that just plays videos.
More precisely it is a bunch of pre-built components and a utility to assemble those components 
into little linux distros that just boot and play your specified videos. No compiling required!

under a debian-esque linux distro try something like:

sudo apt-get install ffmpeg bzip2 rpm2cpio xorriso lz4 mtools

# Installation instructions

VidOS (comprising vobu.sh and the vidos_components dir)
can be optionally installed by running: 

./install.sh

vobu.sh can also be directly used from the release dir.

# Getting Started

# Licences

The various scripts, buildroot configs, configuration scripts and other config files belonging to the VidOS project are 0BSD licenced. 
The compiled output of these however (which constitutes this release) is a linux distribution comprised of many packages with their own licences.
These are contained in the legal.tar.gz archive for the given release at https://github.com/sen-h/VidOS/releases
