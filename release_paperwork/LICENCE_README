Source and licencing info for the third party packages constituting VidOS
and its components have been collected here either manually or using buildroot's
native "make legal-info" target.
systemd-boot (formerly gummiboot) is utilized for efi support and is part of the 
larger systemd project, but due to the nature VidOS build infrastucture the source 
was collected manually.
Source and licencing info for the toolchain was impractical to collect
here, but is availaible at: https://toolchains.bootlin.com/.
Please enjoy.
